#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

# About Me
<font color=#34A853 bold=true>  Looking for research internship for Summer 2025! </font>

Hi, I'm a 2nd-year PhD student advised by Prof. [Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/) at Computer Science department of the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison. 

<!-- My research goal is helping AI systems **fairly** and **safely** serve **diverse** individuals. I focus on natural language processing and machine learning. Specially, I'm working on **LLM Alignment**, mostly **Pluralistic Alignment** and **Personalization**, and **Evaluation**, mostly for better **Human-AI Alignment**. -->

I work on **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. My research focuses on **LLM Alignment**, particularly pluralistic alignment and personalization, as well as **Evaluation** to improve human-AI alignment. Iâ€™m always excited to explore innovative research that pushes AI toward greater fairness, adaptability, and trustworthiness.ðŸ˜Š
<!-- try to integrate sociology and psychology to create more informative and empathetic machine learning models, and topics which have a positive impact on the society.  -->

Previously, I was fortunate to be a visiting student at [SALT](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html) lab in my gap year, coadvised by Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/index.html) from Stanford Univeristy and Prof. [Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/). During my undergraduate years, I worked as a research intern in [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en) of SJTU, coadvised by Prof. [Mengyue Wu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/mengyue-wu), Prof. [Lu Chen](https://coai-sjtu.github.io/), and Prof. [Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/kai_yu).
