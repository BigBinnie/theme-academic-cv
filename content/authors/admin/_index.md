#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

# About Me

Hi, I'm a second-year PhD student advised by Prof. [Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/) at CS department of the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison. 

Previously, I was a visiting student in my gap year at [SALT](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html) lab, coadvised by Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/index.html) from Stanford Univeristy and Prof. [Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/) from the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my B.Eng. degree from the Department of Software Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). During my undergraduate years, I worked as a research intern in [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en) of SJTU, coadvised by Prof. [Mengyue Wu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/mengyue-wu), Prof. [Lu Chen](https://coai-sjtu.github.io/), and Prof. [Kai Yu](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/kai_yu). Our work mainly focuses on the dialogue system for depression diagnosis.

I have broad research interests including social NLP and NLP for social good. More specially, I'm enthusiastic about research topics which have a positive impact on the society such as [NLP for Social Good](https://nlp4sg.vercel.app/), and topics which try to integrate sociology and psychology to create more informative and empathetic machine learning models. 

<font color=#34A853>  Looking for the research intern for Summer 2025! </font>
