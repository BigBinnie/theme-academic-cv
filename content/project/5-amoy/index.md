Amoy Interest, meaning finding your interest in Chinese, is a social media platform like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and [Weibo](https://weibo.com/). Users could share their daily life with everyone on the platform and make friends with people having the same interests conveniently.

The frontend of this platform is built by React, and the Backend is built by SpringBoot. We store data by Mycat for master-slave storage to increase the read-write speed. Additionally, we construct our CI-CD environment by Jenkins.
