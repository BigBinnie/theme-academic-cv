abstract: Chatbots can serve as a viable tool for preliminary depression diagnosis via interactive conversations with potential patients. Nevertheless, the blend of task-oriented and chit-chat in diagnosis-related dialogues necessitates professional expertise and empathy. Such unique requirements challenge traditional dialogue frameworks geared towards single optimization goals. To address this, we propose an innovative ontology definition and generation framework tailored explicitly for depression diagnosis dialogues, combining the reliability of task-oriented conversations with the appeal of empathy-related chit-chat. We further apply the framework to D4, the only existing public dialogue dataset on depression diagnosis-oriented chats. Exhaustive experimental results indicate significant improvements in task completion and emotional support generation in depression diagnosis, fostering a more comprehensive approach to task-oriented chat dialogue system development and its applications in digital mental health.
